Itâ€™s a bar, typically displayed at the top of the screen, containing buttons for navigating up and down a hierarchy. The primary properties are a left (back) button, a center title, and an optional right button. You can specify custom views for each of these. You can modify the appearance of the bar using the barStyle, tintColor, and translucent properties. These properties affect the visual appearance of the bar itself but they also affect the way buttons are displayed in the bar. For example, if you set the translucent property to YES, any buttons in the bar are also made partially opaque.
